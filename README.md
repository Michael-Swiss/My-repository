First, two arrays are declared: the initial one and the second one of the same length. Then the method, in which the loop, commensurate with the length of the array, inside the loop - checking the condition ( <=3 ), if yes, then the element of the first array is entered in the "count" element of the second array. The "count" variable to alternately throw from the first array to the second and so that there are no spaces later. After the assignment, the count variable is incremented by 1 and returns to the for loop in which "i" is incremented by 1. And so it is checked until the end of the first array.
